##  Manchester-Airport-ML

This project develops a Python-based machine learning model to predict aircraft taxi times at Manchester Airport. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce dimensionality, identify key delay factors, and improve prediction accuracy for operational efficiency.

## Overview
The notebook covers the full pipeline:
- Importing and cleaning historical aircraft movement data
- Handling categorical and numerical features
- Feature scaling and correlation analysis
- Applying PCA with scikit-learn for dimensionality reduction
- Training ML models to predict taxi times
- Evaluating model performance with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²
- Visualising explained variance and principal components
  
## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- 
## Files Included
- manchester_airport_ml.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies
- README.md: Project description and instructions

This work was part of a project on multivariate data analysis and operational optimisation.
