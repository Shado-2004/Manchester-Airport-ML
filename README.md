# Manchester-Airport-ML
This project develops a Python-based machine learning model to predict aircraft taxi times at Manchester Airport, aiming to improve operational efficiency. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the model identifies the most influential factors affecting delays and optimizes feature selection for higher prediction accuracy.
